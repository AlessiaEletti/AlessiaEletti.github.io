Prior to becoming a PhD student at the Department of Statistical Science, I completed a Master in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL in 2020 and a Bachelor in Statistics, Finance and Insurance at La Sapienza University of Rome in 2019.

When it came to choosing my university degree, I knew I had always been interested in mathematics related subjects. I started looking into my options and found that Statistics was the perfect mix of mathematical rigor and real-world applicability. By the end of my BSc I had also developed a curiosity for Machine Learning techniques so I did my dissertation on a comparison of statistical and machine learning methods applied to Credit Protection Insurance on US mortgages. This resulted in a published paper and my first public presentation at a conference.

 

To further deepen my knowledge of both Statistics and Machine Learning I chose the MSc in CSML at UCL. After the first few months of being exposed to such a lively and dynamic environment, I became enthusiastic about research and decided I would do a PhD in Statistics. The numerous conversations I had with my now supervisor professor Giampiero Marra were an important part of this decision. In this sense my MSc dissertation, also supervised by professor Marra, served as a test ground on which I explored statistical modelling as I had never seen it before. In particular, I worked on developing flexible parametric models in the context of excess hazards and competing risks.

My current interests remain in the field of flexible and robust parametric modelling in survival analysis. I immediately found this very inspiring as I felt it could have a truly profound impact in applications such as cancer epidemiology studies and research on degenerative diseases. In fact, we could provide clinicians and specialists with instruments which can aid their decision-making process while complementing their field experience.
